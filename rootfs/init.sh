# PID 1 for the CRM stack's Firecracker microVM images.
#
# Vendored from heyo.git infra/firecracker/rootfs/init.sh — keep it close to
# that original so upstream fixes stay diffable.
#
# Firecracker boots the kernel straight into this script (`init=/init.sh` is on
# the kernel command line, and the host builds that line, not the image): there
# is no systemd, no cloud-init and no container runtime, so everything an init
# would normally do happens here — mount the virtual filesystems, bring up
# eth0, start sshd, print the ready marker and then stay alive.
#
# An image without this file does not "fail to start the app": the kernel
# panics before userspace exists, with
#
#     Kernel panic - not syncing: Requested init /init.sh failed (error -2)
#
# which is what every image in this stack did until this was added. The Dockerfile's
# ENTRYPOINT has nothing to do with it — that is Docker metadata, and the
# kernel never reads it. ENTRYPOINT is still what `docker compose up` uses, so
# both ways of running these images keep working.
#
# The `heyo-service` block below is inert here: these images ship no
# /etc/heyo/service.conf, because app-lb's `start_command` launches the app
# once the host has seen HEYVM_READY. It is kept so this file stays a small
# diff against upstream.
#
# Host contract (mvm-ctrl):
#   * `HEYVM_READY` must be printed on the serial console once the VM is up.
#     The host blocks on that exact string, and stray output corrupts the
#     marker-delimited serial protocol — service output belongs in log files.
#   * PID 1 must never exit; that panics the kernel.
